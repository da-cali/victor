# Victor

A sassy trash-talking Codenames bot (under development) in the likeness of his future arch-nemesis [VictoriousChocobo](https://github.com/VictoriousChocobo). This is a WORK IN PROGRESS, but if you want to try the prototype:

### 0. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

### 1. Clone repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/da-cali/victor
cd victor
```

### 2. Create conda environment and install dependencies:

```sh
conda create -n victor python=3.9
conda activate victor
conda env update -f environment.yml
```

### 3. Run scripts.

```sh
python spymaster.py
python operative.py
```
